# Versioning

We have the following guidance for versioning within our repositories.

## Pin to major versions

Per GitHub best practices, we expect that a branch will be created with `v<major>` that is updated to track the current
release for each major branch that has been released.

## Maintenance cycle

We generally strive to keep people on the most recent branch. Older usages should move to more recent versions as soon
as is possible.

### Renovate Bot

Future: We should have clear instructions and expectations around using renovate bot to keep actions up to date with
latest versions.
